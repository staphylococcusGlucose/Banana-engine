# Banana-engine
Awesome! Game Engine Project

## Our goal

It's actually nothing. It would be a great engine to support cross-platforms, and it should be pretty (it should be pretty, not triple A grade)

## What are you going to make of it?

I don't know how to use Vulkan, so I'm going to develop all the platforms in Opengl (ios is going to have to use metal, but that's going to be a story in the distant future). I'm going to develop it in D, and I think I'm going to use Lua, too

## Special note

I don't have any money. So, if you suddenly stop developing and you blow out PR, you might not hear anything. Don't mind the fork, and we only like very, very standard code. If you don't think you can stick to the standard, just make it without a library. Also, the country where the owner of this project was born does not speak English. This Readme is also written through a translator, so for people living in Anglo-American countries and people who are going to read it through the translator, there might be a phrase that would say, "What is this talking about." Please understand
